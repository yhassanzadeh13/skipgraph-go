# Component Package

The `component` package provides a framework for managing application components with lifecycle awareness and hierarchical organization.

## Overview

The component system enables building modular applications where each `Component` has a well-defined lifecycle with ready and done states. `Component`s can be organized hierarchically using the `ComponentManager`, creating tree-like structures where parent `Component`s manage their children.

## Core Concepts

### Component
A `Component` is a module that:
- Can be **started** via the `Start()` method
- Signals when it's **ready** to process requests
- Signals when it's **done** processing and has shut down

### ComponentManager
A `ComponentManager` is itself a component that can manage other components:
- Starts all its child components when started
- Becomes ready only after ALL child components are ready
- Becomes done only after ALL child components are done
- Can contain other `ComponentManager`s, enabling recursive tree structures

## Architecture

                    Root ComponentManager
                           │
                           │ Start()
                           ▼
            ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
            │                             │
            ▼                             ▼

                                                   │
                                             ┌─────┴─────┐
                                             │           │
                                             ▼           ▼

Ready Flow: Component1,2,3,4,5 → Ready → Managers C,A,B → Ready → Root Ready
Done Flow:  Component1,2,3,4,5 → Done  → Managers C,A,B → Done  → Root Done
```

## Usage Example

```go
// Create root manager
root := component.NewManager()

// Create sub-managers
networkManager := component.NewManager()
storageManager := component.NewManager()

// Add components to sub-managers
networkManager.Add(tcpServer)
networkManager.Add(grpcServer)

storageManager.Add(database)
storageManager.Add(cache)

// Build tree structure
root.Add(networkManager)
root.Add(storageManager)

// Start entire tree
ctx := modules.NewThrowableContext(context.Background())
root.Start(ctx)

// Wait for all components to be ready
<-root.Ready()
// Application is now fully initialized

// Shutdown
ctx.Cancel()
<-root.Done()
// Application has cleanly shut down
```

## Key Features

- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic propagation of start, ready, and done signals through the component tree
- **Recursive Structure**: ComponentManagers can contain other ComponentManagers, enabling complex hierarchies
- **Synchronization**: Parent components wait for all children before signaling ready/done
- **Thread Safety**: Safe concurrent access to component state
- **Error Propagation**: Irrecoverable errors bubble up through the ThrowableContext

## Implementation Notes

- Components can only be added before the manager is started
- Each component can only be started once
- The same component cannot be added multiple times to a manager
- Empty managers (with no components) immediately signal ready and done
